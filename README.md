AI robot 
Ai robot project by some 6th Graders!
Let's see how this turns out!
Components;
  Raspberry Pi 5
  Coral AI Accelorrator(4 Tops)
The plan of the project is to, first Get the AI running locally on the pi5, which includes getting the gasket drivers working!
Then, we train the robot to understand how phisics works so that it can come up with REALISTIC ideas on how to move.
Lastly, we need to incorpeate the wheels, Camera, and whatever other actuators we can come up with, on the robot.
